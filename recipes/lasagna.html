        <p>Lasagna first made is a grand entrance in Naples, Italy during the Middle Ages in the 14th century. 
            Initially, this dish was reserved for special events and holidays. 
            Ironically, this pleasure inducing food was introduced to Italians in the middle of the Black Plague.
