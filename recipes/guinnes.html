            Arthur Guinness was just 34 when he signed the iconic 9,000-year Guinness lease, 
            on a then-disused brewery site on 31 December 1759 for an annual rent of Â£45. 
            It was here on this four-acre site where Arthur would hone his craft and build the global brand that 
            Guinness is today.
